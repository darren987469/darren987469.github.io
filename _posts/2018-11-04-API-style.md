I development API with [Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) gem. I found a style or said pattern which works great and decide to write it down.

There are five steps in an API call: `authentication`, `validation`, `authorization`, `operation` and `presentation`. Every step has its own responsibility and we can organize code more structurally. I will use PostAPI to describe each step.

## Authentication

Authenticate user before entering endpoint. If user not authenticated, response 401.

## Validation

Validate request params. If validation failed, response 400. `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` request need to find the resource first. If not found, response 404.

If Grape default validator is not enough, customize new validator or use [form object](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/activemodel-form-objects) to do the validation.

## Authorization

Check the policy of the resource. For example: maybe only paid user can create post or user can post at most 2 posts every day. If failed, response 403.

[Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit), [cancancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) are great gems to handle this.

## Operation

Create, read, update or delete a resource, any business logic about the resource. Prepare the resource for the next step. If any error happened, response the correspond http status code.

## Presentation

Serialize resource. Only logic for transforming format of the resource, such as `post.created_at.strftime('%Y/%m/%d')`.

```ruby
class PostAPI < Grape::API
  rescue_from BadRequestError do { # 400 }
  rescue_from NotAuthenticatedError do { # 401 }
  rescue_from NotAuthorizedError do { # 403 }
  rescue_from NotFoundError do { # 404 }
  rescue_from StandardError do { # 500 }

  resource 'posts' do
    # authentication
    before { authenticate_user! }

    get ':id' do
      # validation and operation
      post = current_user.posts.find(params[:id])

      # presentation
      present post, with: PostEntity
    end

    # validation
    params do
      requires :title, PostEntity.documentation[:title]
    end
    post do
      # authorization
      authorize current_user, PostPolicy, :create?

      # operation
      post = Post.new(title: params[:title])
      error!('Duplicate post', 409) if post.duplicate?
      post.save

      # presentation
      present post, with: PostEntity
    end
  end
end

class PostPolicy
  def create?
    current_user.paid?
  end
end

class PostEntity < Grape::Entity
  expose :title, documentation: { type: String, allow_blank: false }
  expose :created_at

  def created_at
    object.created_at.strftime('%Y/%m/%d')
  end
end
```
